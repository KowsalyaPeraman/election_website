  <h2><u>LOK SABHA</u></h2>
  <p id="para2">The Lok Sabha, constitutionally the House of the People, is the lower house of India's bicameral
    Parliament, with the upper house being the Rajya Sabha. Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by an adult universal
    suffrage and a first-past-the-post system to represent their respective constituencies, and they hold their seats
    for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers. The house
    meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the Parliament House, New Delhi.
    General elections will be held in India from 19 April 2024 to 1 June 2024 to elect the 543 members of the 18th Lok
    Sabha. The elections will be held in seven phases and the results will be announced on 4 June 2024. This will be the
    largest-ever election in history, surpassing the 2019 Indian general election, and will last 44 days, second only to
    the 1951-52 Indian general election. The incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, is
    contesting for a third consecutive term.</p>
